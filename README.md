# Checkpoint-Sorting-and-searching-algorithms

This checkpoint demonstrates the implementation of the insertion sort algorithm using javascript.
- The algorithm sorts an array of numbers in ascending order.
- The original and sorted arrays are displayed on a simple web page.
The code is written in pure javascript and interacts with HTML elements using the DOM.
